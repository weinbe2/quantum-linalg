# quantum-linalg
A set of routines for inverting fermion matrices, perhaps preconditioned. The code is intentionally minimal to emphasize simplicity and extensibility, containing a few blas-like functions, a few iterative solvers, and a stencil framework with support for even/odd preconditioning. Eventually OpenMP and MPI support will be added.
